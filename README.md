# PostHog Templates

![a dalle generated image of a hedgehog by a printing press](./printing-hedgehog.png)

A repository for hosting a list of PostHog Templates, both official and community ones.

## The OG template

The original PostHog template is used in several code paths that don't want to wait for a network call to GitHub - so it is not included here.

You can edit [the template in the PostHog repo](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/master/posthog/models/dashboard_templates.py#L32).
